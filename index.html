      <h2>Web Worker Overview</h2>
      <p>Web worker is a cool feature that allows javascript to be run in a separate thread. Browsers and Javascript are generally considered to be single-threaded (see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2734025/is-javascript-guaranteed-to-be-single-threaded">here</a> for more detailed discussion on the topic), but our computers are multi-core can handle multi-threaded execution. Web workers take advantage of this by running Javascript in a separate OS-level thread.</p>
      <p>But wait, doesn't Javascript's asynchronous nature solve the single-thread limitation? Yes, it certainly addresses the problem, but asynchronous is not the same as being multi-threaded. Javascript is executed based on something called the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/EventLoop">event loop</a>, which can still be somewhat "blocking". More intensive operations can be deligated to web workers to stop the browser from becoming non-responsive. Other practical uses of web workers can be found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2773682/what-are-the-use-cases-for-web-workers">here</a>.</p>
      <h2>Solving Fibonacci with Web Workers</h2>
      <p>Fibonacci can be solved recursively, as seen <a href="http://en.literateprograms.org/Fibonacci_numbers_(JavaScript)">here</a>. This "recursive" characteristic can be replicated by using web workers. Every recursive call is represented by spawning and executing a new web worker. Yes, this is super inefficient and superfluous. This is simply an exercise. A more practical way of utilizing web worker is to simply create one worker that executes the recursive fibonacci algorithm by itself.</p>

      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <p>
        ***Run this on Fire Fox. Chrome and some other browsers does not currently support web worker spawning inside web worker.</p>
      <p>
        ***Also, there is a limit to the number of workers. Fibonacci above with n > 8 does not run successfully.
